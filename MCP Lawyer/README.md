### API Documentation

The MCP Server provides a comprehensive API for managing roles, memories, and processing queries:

#### Role Management

- `GET /api/v1/roles` - List all roles
- `GET /api/v1/roles/{role_id}` - Get a specific role
- `POST /api/v1/roles` - Create a new role
- `PUT /api/v1/roles/{role_id}` - Update a role
- `DELETE /api/v1/roles/{role_id}` - Delete a role

#### Memory Management

- `GET /api/v1/memories/{role_id}` - Get memories for a role
- `POST /api/v1/memories` - Create a new memory
- `DELETE /api/v1/memories/{role_id}` - Clear all memories for a role

#### Query Processing

- `POST /api/v1/roles/process` - Process a query with role-specific context

## Core Concepts

### Roles

Roles are the foundation of the MCP Server. Each role represents a specialized AI assistant with specific expertise, personality traits, and behavior guidelines.

#### Role Properties

- **id**: Unique identifier for the role
- **name**: Display name for the role
- **description**: Brief description of the role's purpose
- **instructions**: Specific guidelines for how the role should behave
- **domains**: Areas of expertise (e.g., Finance, Marketing, Technical Support)
- **tone**: Communication style (professional, casual, friendly, technical, formal)
- **system_prompt**: Advanced configuration for the AI model
- **is_default**: Whether this is a default role

#### Creating Effective Roles

When creating roles, consider the following best practices:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the role's expertise and limitations
2. **Set Clear Guidelines**: Provide detailed instructions on how the role should respond
3. **Define Tone**: Choose a tone that matches the role's purpose
4. **Craft System Prompts**: Use system prompts to fine-tune behavior

### Memories

Memories provide context for AI roles, allowing them to maintain information across conversations.

#### Memory Properties

- **id**: Unique identifier for the memory
- **role_id**: The role this memory belongs to
- **content**: The actual memory content
- **type**: Type of memory (e.g., conversation, fact, preference)
- **importance**: Importance level (affects retrieval priority)
- **embedding**: Vector representation for semantic search
- **created_at**: Timestamp when the memory was created

### Query Processing

Query processing combines roles, memories, and user input to generate contextually relevant responses.

#### Processing Flow

1. User sends a query for a specific role
2. Server retrieves the role configuration
3. Server fetches relevant memories for context
4. Server constructs a prompt with role instructions, tone, and memories
5. Server sends the prompt to OpenAI's API
6. Server returns the AI-generated response to the client

## Client Interface

### Role Management

The client provides a user-friendly interface for managing AI roles:

#### Role List

The Roles page displays all available roles with options to:
- View role details
- Edit existing roles
- Delete roles
- Create new roles

#### Role Creation

The role creation form allows you to define all aspects of a new AI role:

1. **Basic Information**:
   - Name: A descriptive name for the role
   - Description: Brief summary of the role's purpose

2. **Expertise Configuration**:
   - Domains: Areas of expertise for the role
   - Tone: Communication style

3. **Behavior Guidelines**:
   - Instructions: Specific guidelines for how the role should behave
   - System Prompt: Advanced configuration for the AI model

### Chat Interface

The Chat page provides an interactive interface for conversing with AI roles:

1. **Role Selection**: Choose from available roles
2. **Conversation**: Send messages and receive AI responses
3. **Context Awareness**: The AI maintains context throughout the conversation

## Examples

### Creating a Legal Advisor Role

```json
{
  "id": "legal-advisor",
  "name": "Legal Advisor",
  "description": "Provides internal legal guidance on matters such as contract interpretation, compliance with Canadian law, and risk assessment for law practices.",

  "domains": ["Internal Legal Guidance", "Contract Law", "Compliance"],
  "tone": "professional",
  "system_prompt": "You are LegalGPT, an AI assistant dedicated to assisting law firms with internal legal queries. Your responses should be clear, precise, and fully aligned with Canadian legal standards, tailored to internal use within a law practice. Use structured formats like bullet points when necessary."
}
```

### Creating a Litigation Specialist Role

```json
{
  "id": "litigation-specialist",
  "name": "Litigation Specialist",
  "description": "Provides expert advice on litigation strategies, evidence management, and court procedures, tailored for internal use by legal teams.",
  "instructions": "You are a litigation specialist with extensive experience in Canadian court systems. Offer actionable guidance on case strategy, evidence collection, and courtroom procedures, focusing on the practical needs of an internal legal team.",
  "domains": ["Litigation", "Case Strategy", "Court Procedures"],

Provide structured, detailed advice on managing litigation processes, preparing for court, and handling evidence, with a strong focus on Canadian legal procedures and internal law firm protocols."
}
```

### Sample Conversations

#### Legal Advisor Conversation

**User**: As an internal counsel, I need guidance on drafting a partnership agreement with a tech firm. What key clauses should we include to protect our firm and ensure compliance with Canadian law?

**AI**: For an effective internal review of a partnership agreement, consider including clauses that address:
 - **Partnership Contributions**: Clearly define financial and non-financial contributions from all parties.
 - **Profit-Sharing**: Detail the mechanisms for profit and loss distribution.
 - **Dispute Resolution**: Specify internal protocols for mediation or arbitration in the event of disputes.
 - **Confidentiality and Data Protection**: Ensure that all proprietary and client-related information is safeguarded in accordance with Canadian privacy laws.
 - **Compliance Clauses**: Incorporate provisions that mandate adherence to Canadian partnership laws and internal firm policies, including periodic reviews.

#### Litigation Specialist Conversation

**User**: Our firm has received notice of a lawsuit alleging breach of contract. What immediate steps should our litigation team take?

**AI**: In response to a breach of contract claim, the litigation team should:
 1. **Review the Complaint**: Analyze the allegations in detail to identify the key legal issues.
 2. **Document Collection**: Gather all relevant contracts, correspondence, and internal memos related to the dispute.
 3. **Internal Strategy Session**: Convene a meeting with senior counsel to assess the case and determine the optimal defense strategy.
 4. **Court Procedure Preparation**: Prepare to file appropriate motions (e.g., a motion to dismiss) and ensure all documents comply with Canadian court procedures.
 5. **Risk Management**: Evaluate the potential financial and reputational risks, and consider whether settlement negotiations may be in the best interest of the firm.

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing System Prompts

System prompts are powerful tools for fine-tuning AI behavior. Here are some tips for crafting effective system prompts:

1. **Define Identity**: Clearly state who the AI is and its expertise
2. **Set Boundaries**: Define what the AI should and shouldn't do
3. **Specify Format**: Indicate how responses should be structured
4. **Include Examples**: Provide examples of ideal responses

### Fine-tuning Role Behavior

To fine-tune role behavior:

1. **Adjust Instructions**: Modify the role's instructions to guide behavior
2. **Change Tone**: Select a different tone to alter communication style
3. **Add Memories**: Create memories with important information
4. **Refine Domains**: Update expertise domains to focus the role's knowledge
